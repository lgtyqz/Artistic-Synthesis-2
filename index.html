        <h1>What is art?</h1>
        <h2>Art is the result of an artistic process.</h2>
        <h3>The artistic or creative process involves creating something using your own personal image of the desired result.</h3>
        <h3>Making something you want to make, that is.</h3>
        <h3>That means a lot of things are artistic endeavors, even if you've never thought of them that way.</h3>
        <h3>Like gardening, for example.</h3>
        <h3>Creating a garden is a whole process that involves planning and creating an image of what flowers you want and where, sometimes regardless of any aesthetic preferences.</h3>
        <h3>So gardening is art.</h3>
        <h3>But anyways, the point is that YOU can do art.</h3>
        <h3>YOU aren't an artist in a museum, sure. But art doesn't have to be in museums.</h3>
        <h4>What people see as artistic is cultural anyways, and more emphasis is placed culturally on museum art than the artistic processes surrounding us, whether in the arts or engineering or in the sciences.</h4>
        <h2>Point is, you (YOU) can make art.</h2>
        <h3>And you can create something aesthetically pleasing below too.</h3>
